## What can I do to help?
The core principle of this project is to provide courses that have AI as teachers. The virtual teachers won't be connected to any LLM. That means they will be hardcoded. You can add additional features, change the design, or add something yourself.

## I don't know how to code?
Reach out to the group admins so they can teach you.
